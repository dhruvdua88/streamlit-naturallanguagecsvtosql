# **CSV to SQLite Query Builder**

A Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload a CSV file, convert it into an SQLite database, generate SQL queries using natural language prompts via the Google Gemini API, and execute those queries to display results.

---

## **Features**

1. **Upload CSV File**:
   - Users can upload any CSV file, and the app will automatically convert it into an SQLite database table.

2. **Header Description**:
   - The app lists all column headers from the uploaded CSV file and provides a brief description of each.

3. **Natural Language Query Generation**:
   - Users can input a natural language prompt (e.g., "Find all rows where age > 30"), and the app generates the corresponding SQL query using the Google Gemini API.

4. **SQL Query Execution**:
   - The generated SQL query is executed on the SQLite database, and the results are displayed in a user-friendly table format.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The app includes error handling for invalid queries or missing inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

---

## **How It Works**

1. Upload a CSV file.
2. View the column headers and their descriptions.
3. Enter a natural language prompt to generate an SQL query.
4. Review the generated SQL query.
5. View the results of the executed query.

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Google Generative AI API key

### **Steps**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/csv-to-sqlite-query-builder.git
   cd csv-to-sqlite-query-builder
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## **Usage**

1. Open the app in your browser after running the `streamlit` command.
2. Upload a CSV file using the file uploader.
3. Enter a natural language prompt (e.g., "Find all rows where city = 'New York'").
4. Click the "Generate SQL Query" button to see the generated SQL query.
5. View the results of the query execution below.

---

## **Example Workflow**

### **Input CSV**
```csv
name,age,city
Alice,25,New York
Bob,30,Los Angeles
Charlie,35,Chicago
```

### **Prompt**
```
Find all rows where age > 30
```

### **Generated SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT * FROM csv_data WHERE age > 30;
```

### **Results**
| name    | age | city      |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| Charlie | 35  | Chicago   |

## **Dependencies**

The app relies on the following libraries:

- `streamlit`: For building the web interface.
- `pandas`: For reading and processing CSV files.
- `sqlite3`: For creating and querying the SQLite database.
- `google-generativeai`: For interacting with the Google Gemini API.

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Environment Variables**

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google Generative AI API key. Store this securely in a `.env` file or as an environment variable.
